# -Build-a-network-for-Both-UHD-Goyzha-and-Qaradax-Camps-Interconnect-through-OSPF-Routing-protocol-
Design LANS with Hierarchical Network Model, select technology and assign IP address. We consider for each camp, we have different VLANS since UHD have different departments one VLAN for each Department. Build network design and distribute IPv4 and IPv6 across network design. Computer, Switch layer2, Switch layer3, Router, Telephone, Server, Firewall, Fiber Optic cable, and Rack Diagram are used. VLANS, Trunk, Inter-Vlan routing (SVI), Securing with Vlan (VACL), Wireless LAN, IP Telephony, Voip, DHCP, Port security, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, DNS, NTP, Syslog Server, RSTP, SSH, OSPFv2, OSPFv3 (Multi Area) routing protocol , Firewall Security, and ACL will be configured. In addition, Rack diagram by Visio and List of device will be put. Finally, Trouble shoot and documentation will be implemented. An example of topology is shown from the following diagram. So, those technology uses in this project they are use in most networking company today.  MS Visio use to design our network and use packet tracer for configuration. MS Visio use to design our network and packet tracer version6.2 used for configuration.
